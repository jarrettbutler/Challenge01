# UNB Coding Bootcamp Challenge 01

## Description

This challenge was to take old code and update the semantics of the HTML to modernize it for search engines. This allows the codebase to follow accesibility standards so the site will be optimized for search engines, have a higher reputation as it will be more accesible and more people will hold it in high regard on social media for its updated accesibility. What this means is that the site will be closer to the top search as it will be more accessible for people with disabilities. Updating the semantic HTML allows the website be read by the page veiwer.

## Installation

The easiest way to get my project running will be clicking/copy pasting the link into a default browser that will automatically open the webpage. Or you could open the code and open in a default browser.

## Usage

The site is used for marketing telling yuo what the benifits are of updating semantic HTML for accesibility purposes.

## Tests

In the original code the Search Engine Optimization header was not connected to the main article. Now if you click the "Search Engine Optimization" in the header it will take you down to the article. Try it out!
